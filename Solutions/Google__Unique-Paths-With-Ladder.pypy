You have a 2d grid of numbers representing heights. Now imagine you have a ladder k. 
You can only walk right or down to another grid if that grid is less than or equal to the current grid plus k. 
Return the number of unique paths. （高频 x4）

dp[i][j] = the number of unique paths to reach (i, j).
dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j] if grid[i][j] <= grid[i-1][j] + k;
dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1] if grid[i][j] <= grid[i][j-1] + k
