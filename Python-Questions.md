1. You are using collections.deque, what is collections?
Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example, list, dict, set, tuple etc. 
These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data.

When to use yield instead of return in Python?
The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list. Any function that contains a yield keyword is termed as generator. Hence, yield is what makes a generator. yield keyword in Python is less known off but has a greater utility which one can think of.
