947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

On a 2D plane, we place stones at some integer coordinate points.  Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

Now, a move consists of removing a stone that shares a column or row with another stone on the grid.

What is the largest possible number of moves we can make?

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0

Use two for loops to compare each pos with another pos in the list, if two positions share same row or col,
then we should union them, each time there is a union, it means we can do one removal, then we set cnt+=1

"""
The improved DSU solution creates a map of all the nodes with a certain X coordinate
and a second map with all the nodes with a Y coordinate. 
This allows us to quickly join all of a node's neighbour into a set. 
This improves the naÃ¯ve DSU implementation from O(n^2) to O(n)!!
Algorithm: when we see a stone that appears in a row or a column at the first time, 
we define this stone as the parent of this row and column, 
next time we see a new stone, just union it with its parent, which stores in the hashmap, 
thus we can do it in one pass.
Very cool!!
