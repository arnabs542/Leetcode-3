362. Design Hit Counter

Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.

Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order (ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.

It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.

Example:

HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.
counter.hit(1);

// hit at timestamp 2.
counter.hit(2);

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
counter.getHits(4);

// hit at timestamp 300.
counter.hit(300);

// get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
counter.getHits(300);

// get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
counter.getHits(301);

What if the number of hits per second could be very large? Does your design scale?

# Your HitCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = HitCounter()
# obj.hit(timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.getHits(timestamp)

这里不是用deque吗？deque里面默认是每一个时间戳hit了一次，如果需要记录每秒钟有几次hit，我们需要用到dictionary, 但是同时有需要deque一样的有序，
所以自然而然想到OrderedDict. 这样可以保证最多使用O(300)的空间, 还是要熟悉OrderedDict的方法的。
OrderedDict是deque的增强版，这一点在LRU那题中已经体现。
