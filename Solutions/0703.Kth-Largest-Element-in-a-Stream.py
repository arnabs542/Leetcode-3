703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Your KthLargest class will have a constructor which accepts an integer k and an integer array nums, which contains initial elements from the stream. For each call to the method KthLargest.add, return the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

Example:

int k = 3;
int[] arr = [4,5,8,2];
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, arr);
kthLargest.add(3);   // returns 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // returns 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // returns 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // returns 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // returns 8


""""
heap solution: maintain a hq with size k, the kth largest is always hq[0] - O(nlogn)
Maybe we can do log time complexity for add method using a redâ€“black tree, 
red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, Google requires at least talk about it.
