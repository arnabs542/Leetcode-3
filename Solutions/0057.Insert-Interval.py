57. Insert Interval

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

Append the new interval to the intervals, and then do the merge interval problem

        intervals.sort(key = lambda interval: (interval[0], interval[1]))   # only the last item is not sorted, to sort a nearly sorted list, we use insertion sort - close to O(N)

                res[-1][-1] = max(res[-1][-1], interval[1])
        
        return res

Facebook follow up:  How do you add intervals and merge them for a large stream of intervals?
Since each insert takes O(N), it is not wise to use list as the data structure.  
BST is a good data structure to enable O(logn) insertion and O(logn) query as well.
We need to have two functions for the tree (add interval and query tree).
