Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

"""设f[i][j]为A前i个字符A[0..i)和B前j个字符[0..j)的最长公共子串的长度，注意不包括i和j，前面有一层buffer layer非常重要，就像sputtering那样重要！f[i][j]=max(f[i][j-1], f[i-1][j], f[i-1][j-1] when A[i-1]=B[j-1])"""
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        if not text1 or not text2:
            return 0
        
        m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j])
                
                if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1)
                    
        return dp[-1][-1]
