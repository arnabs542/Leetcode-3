1. When talk about the experience, I can talk about the experience of using binary search to optimize the algorithm of 
manipulating MicroSense8T raw data, in detals.  I feel excited about it. And I found that my passion really lies in using
computing algorithms to make modern technology more efficient better scale.  That's why I submit my resume to Google, a company
who did a great job, probabaly the best job to implement computer science to make modern technology more efficient and change the world.
